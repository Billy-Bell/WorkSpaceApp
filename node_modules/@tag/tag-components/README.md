# Tag library

The tag library is a native web component library generated by stencil.js.

Visit (https://tag-library.azurewebsites.net)[https://tag-library.azurewebsites.net] to see the library catalogue.

## Audiences

There are three audiences of developer that will be interacting with the tag-library. Each has their own getting started guide below.

The first and most common will be "App builders". You are building applications using the shared components of the tag library to help accelerate the development of your applications.

The second group is the "Component builders". You are building the components for the tag library that you can then use within the development of your own applications or shared across the group.

The third group are the "Tool builders". You build the tools that make the development experience of the Component builders and then the App builders better.

## Get started - App builders

To start using the tag-library in your application add the following two references in the head of app.

```html
<link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Lato:300|Roboto:400" rel="stylesheet">
<script src="https://tag-library.azurewebsites.net/tag-library.js"></script>
```

Now you can add into your application:

```html
<tag-button accent="Access">Hi I'm a button</tag-button>
```

And you have an Access red button.

## Get started - Component builders

To start building components, first clone the repo.

Then run:

```
$ npm install
```

```
$ npm start
```

This will run a local version of the tag-library catalogue at localhost:3366

to create a new component run:

```
$ npm run comp.new -- --name NAME-OF-YOUR-COMPONENT
```

To test your local component in an application then you can reference:

```html
<script src="http://localhost:3377/tag-library.js"></script>
```

## Get started - Tool builders

Coming soon...
